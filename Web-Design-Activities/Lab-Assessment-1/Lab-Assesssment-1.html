				<h3 style="color: darkblue">Hard Disk Drives</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify">
					<strong>Hard Disk Drives</strong> or HDDs are traditional storage
					devices used in personal computers. These use an electromechanical
					approach to data storage and retrieval. There are multiple spinning
					magnetic disks for this purpose.

				<h3 style="color: darkblue">Solid State Drives</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify">
					<strong>Solid State Drives</strong> or SSDs are a type of storage
					device that stores data on flash memory. They are somewhat more
					sophisticated than HDDs as they do not have any moving parts. When
					someone refers to an SSD, they generally mean a SATA SSD. SATA stands
					for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment and currently is the market
					standard for connecting computers to SSDs. The interface was, however,
					developed for HDDs, and even though SSDs are compatible with it, it is
					not the best they can do.

				<h3 style="color: darkblue">Non-Volatile Memory Express</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify">
					<strong>NVMe</strong> stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express. An NVMe
					SSD is a solid state drive that uses an M.2 form factor to connect to
					the motherboard, instead of a cable. Additionally, they use PCIe
					(Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) interface, which provides
					a much more efficient way to transfer data.
